    <h1>Assignment 2: Understanding Logistics</h1>
    <p><strong>Student:</strong> AKIB ABU SALEH MD<br><strong>ID:</strong> 2217655</p>

    <h2>What are the main components of logistics?</h2>
    <p>Based on my research and class discussion, logistics includes many areas that all work together. First, you have to find raw materials, then store them properly in warehouses. Transportation is a huge part — moving goods by trucks, ships, or planes. Information and control systems help track and manage everything. Other parts include supply chain coordination, inventory management, and making sure orders are fulfilled properly. I also think customer service is super important, and honestly, people’s laziness sometimes affects logistics too!</p>

    <h2>Why do companies invest in logistics?</h2>
    <p>Companies care about logistics because it helps reduce costs and makes their operations smoother. When logistics are done well, customers get their products faster and are happier. That gives a company an advantage over others. Also, with good logistics, businesses can manage risks and scale up operations. Nowadays, there’s also pressure to be more environmentally friendly, so green logistics is becoming a thing too.</p>

    <h2>Why is logistics important?</h2>
    <p>It’s important because it improves how efficient the whole supply chain is. Everything from getting materials to delivering the final product relies on logistics. If it’s not organized well, it causes delays and makes customers frustrated. But if done right, it builds trust and saves money.</p>

    <h2>What is the impact of logistics on competition?</h2>
    <p>Logistics definitely affects how companies compete. If a company can deliver products faster or cheaper, they get ahead of others. For example, if there’s a high demand for shoes, companies like Nike need to act quickly to get materials and deliver. If they’re slow, customers might just go with Adidas or Puma. So better logistics means better performance in the market.</p>

    <h2>What are some current and future trends in logistics?</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Automation and AI:</strong> Warehouses are now using robots and automated systems to make things faster and reduce errors.</li>
      <li><strong>3D Printing:</strong> In the future, companies might use 3D printing to produce items closer to where customers are.</li>
      <li><strong>Sustainability:</strong> Many logistics companies are trying to be greener. For example, FedEx wants to be carbon-neutral by 2040.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Example Companies</h2>
    <p>I looked into CJ Logistics and Coupang Rocket Delivery. They are both known for their fast and efficient delivery services. Coupang even guarantees next-day delivery in South Korea, which is impressive and shows how logistics can become a selling point for a company.</p>
