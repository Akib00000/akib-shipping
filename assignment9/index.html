    <h1>Assignment 12: ABC Classification & Slotting Strategy</h1>

    <h2>Design Thinking Steps</h2>
    <h3>Empathize</h3>
    <p>Warehouse workers and managers face congestion and inefficiencies due to unoptimized layouts. They need a better strategy to reduce travel distance and improve picking speed.</p>

    <h3>Define</h3>
    <p><strong>Problem Statement:</strong> Our warehouse layout does not reflect SKU activity levels, leading to extra travel time and delays during order picking.</p>

    <h3>Ideate</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Classify SKUs based on pick frequency (ABC classification)</li>
      <li>Design new zones prioritizing accessibility</li>
      <li>Apply Pareto analysis to determine which SKUs should be closer to the dock</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Prototype</h3>
    <p>Using the 5x6 warehouse grid and pick frequency data, SKUs were classified:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>A items</strong> (Top 20% of cumulative picks) were placed closest to the dock</li>
      <li><strong>B items</strong> (Next 30%) were placed in mid-access areas</li>
      <li><strong>C items</strong> (Remaining 50%) were stored farthest away or in less accessible zones</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Test</h3>
    <p>By comparing the heatmap of the initial and optimized layouts, we observed that most of the high-frequency items were now closer to the dock at (4,3), minimizing travel distance and expected congestion.</p>

    <h2>Results & Justification</h2>
    <p>I performed a Pareto analysis and computed the cumulative pick frequency percentages. Based on this, I assigned ABC categories and rearranged SKU positions accordingly, avoiding the blocked cell at (2,4). This led to a more efficient layout.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Tools Used:</strong> Excel (CSV analysis), heatmap visualization, HTML for documentation</p>

    <p>Full documentation with updated grid and heatmap is available in the revised CSV and visual layout files.</p>
