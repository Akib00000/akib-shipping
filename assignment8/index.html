    <h1>Assignment – Week 11: Problem Research & Learning Activity</h1>
    <p><strong>Student:</strong> AKIB ABU SALEH MD<br><strong>ID:</strong> 2217655</p>

    <h2>🎯 Selected Logistics Stage: Reverse Logistics</h2>

    <h3>🔍 Research Phase</h3>
    <p><strong>Initial Problem:</strong><br>
      Reverse logistics is a part of supply chain management I didn’t understand much before. It’s all about managing returned goods, recycling, repairs, and the flow back to the supplier. I found out that this process can be very costly and complicated, especially for e-commerce companies.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Empathize:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Problem Overview:</strong> Companies face huge issues managing returns.</li>
      <li><strong>Common Causes:</strong> Manual processing, unclear product handling strategy, disconnected systems.</li>
      <li><strong>Examples:</strong> Fashion brands like Zara struggle with fast returns. Apple recycles but has global challenges managing returns.</li>
      <li><strong>Impact:</strong> High costs, wasted resources, environmental harm.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>🧪 Learning Activity Design</h3>
    <p><strong>Define – Problem Statement:</strong><br>
      "Students need to understand how reverse logistics impacts operations and the environment, and learn how to make smart decisions about handling returned products."
    </p>

    <p><strong>Ideate – Activity Idea:</strong><br>
      <em>Reverse Logistics Game</em> – an interactive simulation where students act as logistics managers.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Players get different types of returned items.</li>
      <li>Decide whether to recycle, refurbish, resell, or discard.</li>
      <li>Points based on cost-saving and environmental impact.</li>
      <li>Realistic constraints like space and budget.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Student Task:</strong> Analyze and choose handling methods for returns to minimize cost and maximize sustainability.</p>

    <h3>🎓 Why This Helps</h3>
    <p>
      This game helps students (like me) see how complex reverse logistics is and trains us to make smart decisions. It connects cost-efficiency with environmental thinking in a fun way.
